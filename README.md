Click the "+" button in the Source Control view and select "Initialize Repository".
This creates a new Git repository within your project folder, initializing the necessary files (.git) for version control.
Making Commits:
After making changes to your code, stage the changes you want to include in your next commit. You can stage individual files or lines of code, or stage all changes at once.
Stage specific lines: Right-click on a line of code and select "Stage Lines".
Stage a whole file: Right-click on a file in the Explorer sidebar and select "Stage Changes".
Stage all changes: Click the blue button in the Source Control view that says "Stage All Changes".
Once you've staged your desired changes, type a commit message summarizing the changes you made. A commit message is crucial for future reference.
Click the green checkmark button in the Source Control view (or press Ctrl+Enter) to commit your staged changes.
Pushing Changes to GitHub:
Assuming you have a remote repository set up on GitHub (like a project repository), you can push your local commits to it.
In the Source Control view, click on the "..." menu next to the branch name (usually "main").
Select "Publish Branch" if it's your first push, or "Push to <remote name>" if you've already connected.
You might be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials for authentication.
This pushes your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub, making your code changes accessible online and allowing for collaboration with others.
Additional Features:
VS Code's Git integration offers many more features beyond these basic steps:
Viewing Commit History: See a history of all your commits with the ability to revert to previous versions.
Branching and Merging: Create and manage different development branches and merge them back into your main branch.
Conflict Resolution: Resolve conflicts if different changes occur in the same part of the code across branches.
GitLens Extension (Optional): Install the GitLens extension for a richer Git experience with visualizations and advanced features.
